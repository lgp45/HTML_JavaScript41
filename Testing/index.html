    <!--Paragraphs about me-->
    <p>My name is Lucas but I always go by Luke.  I grew up in central Pennsylvania playing every sport but Baseball.  I then moved to Virginia for a few years prior to resettling in Rhode Island with to be near some of my family.  From a young age I was always fascinated by almost all things technology related.  I knew rather early on in my life that I wanted to work with computers.  As a young kid I was also heavily exposed to video games on computers and especially consoles such as Super Nintendo and my all time childhood favorite the Nintendo 64.  From there, it is a easy guess how I chose to pursure a career within the realm of Video Games and their creation.  Apart from the Game aspect, coding has always been something I have found fascinating; dabbling in a variety of languages while creating mods for games as well as even trying to make my own in Unity.     </p>
